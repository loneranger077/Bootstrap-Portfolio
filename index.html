                        My name is Nick and I am a web development student at a Georgia Tech boot camp. I have previously attended here several years back as an Aerospace Engineering major, but did not graduate. However, I have returned with a vengeance to tackle coding... I have previously been employed as a lifeguard both at neighborhood pools and indoor lap pools; at Jet's Pizza as a delivery driver; and more recently been an associate/shift manager at Racetrac. So I have a diverse knowledge and skill base to draw from in my life so far. I hope to accomplish great things with this new direction I have taken!

                        I was born in Huntsville, AL (Rocket City FTW), but mainly was raised and currently reside in the Atlanta area. I grew up going to Georgia Tech football games at Bobby Dodd Stadium, so I am happy to be back on campus!
